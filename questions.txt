Do you secretly worry that others will find out that you are not as bright and capable as they think you are?
Do you sometimes shy away from challenges because of a nagging self-doubt?
Do you tend to chalk your accomplishments up to being a fluke no big deal or the fact that people just like you?
Do you hate making a mistake, being less than fully prepared or not doing things perfectly?
Do you tend to feel crushed even by constructive criticism, seeing it as evidence of your ineptness?
When you do succeed, do you think, "phew" I fooled them this time but I may not be that lucky next time?
Do you believe that other people (students, colleagues, competitors) are smarter and more capable than you?
Do you live in fear of being found out, discovered, or un-masked?
